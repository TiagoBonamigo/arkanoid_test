## Progress Log
| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 18:05 | Initialized workspace |
| 22:45 | Checked tasks.md - TASK-008 assigned and marked in-progress |
| 22:45 | Status: BLOCKED - waiting on TASK-001 and TASK-003 |

## Blockers / Questions
- **BLOCKED ON TASK-001**: Project structure doesn't exist yet (no src/ directory)
- **BLOCKED ON TASK-003**: Event System needs typed event constants from types file
- Cannot create src/core/EventBus.ts until project structure exists

## Ready to Implement
Once unblocked, will implement src/core/EventBus.ts with singleton pattern, on/off/emit methods, and typed events

## Completed Tasks
*None yet*
